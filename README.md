# Getting Started with Machine Learning in Python

### Description

This workshop provides an introduction to machine learning using Python. Participants will use Scikit-Learn, NumPy and Matplotlib to solve problems using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

For more Research Computing workshops on machine learning, see the [Fall 2025 program](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/learn/workshops-live-training).

### Run Notebooks Using Google Colab

Click on a notebook above such as `notebook1_regression.ipynb`. After the notebook loads, click on the "Open in Colab" button. Run the cells. If you encounter the message "Warning: This notebook was not authored by Google" then choose "Run anyway".

### Run Notebooks Using Jupyterlite

1. Point your browser to [https://jdh4.github.io/python_machine_learning/](https://jdh4.github.io/python_machine_learning/)
2. After the JupyterLite interface loads, in the file browser on the left, double-click on a notebook such as `notebook1_regression.ipynb`
3. Run the notebook as usual by clicking on the "play" button and so on.

The preferred web browsers are Firefox 90+ and Chromium 89+.

### Winter 2026 Training

There will be a 5-part machine learning mini-course in January 2026. Subscribe to the [Research Computing mailing list](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/subscribe) for updates.

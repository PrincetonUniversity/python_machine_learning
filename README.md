# Getting Started with Machine Learning in Python

### Description

This workshop provides an introduction to machine learning using Python. Participants will use Scikit-Learn, NumPy and Matplotlib to solve problems using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

For more PICSciE/RC workshops on machine learning see the [Spring 2024 line-up](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/learn/workshops-live-training).

### Run Using Jupyterlite

1. Point your browser to [https://jdh4.github.io/python_machine_learning/](https://jdh4.github.io/python_machine_learning/)
2. After the JupyterLite interface loads, in the file browser on the left, double-click on a notebook such as `notebook1_regression.ipynb`
3. Run the notebook as usual by clicking on the "play" button and so on.

The preferred web browsers are Firefox 90+ and Chromium 89+.
